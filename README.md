## üéØ Project Objectives & Focus Areas

### 1. Bank Data Analysis (Focus: Operational Health & Metrics)
* **Goal:** To analyze key bank metrics like total loan amounts, loan disbursement, interest collection, and late fees to assess overall operational health and loan portfolio performance.
* **Key Insight:** Analyzed **$751M in total loan amount** to find that the **26-35 age group** represents the largest segment of borrowers (**34.75%**), while the portfolio shows an **Average Loan Interest Rate of 12.03%** and **$82K in Late Fees Collected**. This data pinpoints the most valuable customer segment for marketing and establishes a clear baseline for monitoring collection efficiency.

### 2. Credit & Debit Transaction Analysis (Focus: Customer Behavior & Risk)
* **Goal:** To dissect customer spending patterns, transaction volumes, and flag high-risk or unusual credit/debit activity to improve fraud detection and inform branch performance strategy.
* **Key Insight:** Dissected **$254.89M in transaction volume** to reveal that **Debit Card transactions (33.41%)** are slightly higher than Credit Card transactions (33.32%) and are the largest method category. The analysis confirms the **City Center Branch** as the highest volume location ($42.91M$), and shows a sharp drop in total credit/debit activity in December, informing staff allocation and year-end fraud monitoring priorities.
